# Code for 'Computational Methods for Traditional Scholarship in the Humanities' (AS.100.682)

In addition to providing documentation and example code for various aspects of the course, this repository serves as an example of how to set up a coding environment for new projects.

The experiments defined here take approximately 2 hours to run from start to finish, most of which is spent on the English poetry domain.

## Quick start

Clone this repository and change into the new directory by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/comp-int-hum/AS.100.682.git
$ cd AS.100.682
```

Create a local environment (a "bubble"), enter the bubble, and install the libraries used by the experiments:

```
$ python3 -m venv local
$ source local/bin/activate
(local) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
